--WRONG!!!  Supposed to be 1/3rd of this amount. Mary & Mahesh got it wrong too.
--playerid shows up three times in collegeplaying table (for each year played in school), causes 
---triple count of salaries.
--WRONG:
SELECT p.playerid, schoolname, namefirst, namelast, SUM(salary)::numeric::money as total_salary
FROM schools AS s 
		JOIN collegeplaying AS cp USING(schoolid)  --LEFT and INNER JOIN also work for all joins.
		JOIN people AS p ON p.playerid = cp.playerid
		JOIN salaries as sal ON sal.playerid = p.playerid
	WHERE schoolname like '%Vanderbilt%'
--		AND salary IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY p.playerid, schoolname, namefirst, namelast, namegiven
ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

--Fixed --WIP  NOT DONE YET:
WITH vandyplayers AS (SELECT DISTINCT p.playerid, schoolname, namefirst || ' ' || namelast as player_name
						FROM schools AS s 
								JOIN collegeplaying AS cp USING(schoolid)  --LEFT and INNER JOIN also work for all joins.
								JOIN people AS p ON p.playerid = cp.playerid
								JOIN salaries as sal ON sal.playerid = p.playerid
							WHERE schoolname like '%Vanderbilt%'
					 	GROUP BY p.playerid, schoolname, namefirst, namelast, namegiven)
SELECT SUM(sal.salary)::numeric::money as total_salary, 
FROM vandyplayers;
FROM schools AS s 
	JOIN collegeplaying AS cp USING(schoolid)  --LEFT and INNER JOIN also work for all joins.
	JOIN people AS p ON p.playerid = cp.playerid
	JOIN salaries as sal ON sal.playerid = p.playerid
--ORDER BY total_salary DESC;

select distinct namefirst || ' ' || namelast as player_name, schoolname, sum(salary)::numeric::money as total_salary  -- || is concatenate
from people
	join collegeplaying    --default join is INNER. Doing INNER join prevents NULL values. Cool!
